Project: Simple Task Manager
Project Description: Create a console-based task manager application in Java. Users can add, view, edit, and delete tasks. Tasks can have a title, description, and due date.
Tasks:
1.	Setup Project:
        • Create a new Java project using your preferred IDE or build tool (e.g., Maven or Gradle).
2.	Create Task Class:
        • Define a Task class with attributes like title, description, due date, and status.
3.	Implement Task Management:
        • Implement basic functionality to add, view, edit, and delete tasks.
        • Use an array or a list to store tasks.
4.	User Interface:
        • Create a simple text-based user interface to interact with the application.
        • Provide options for adding, viewing, editing, and deleting tasks.
5.	Task Validation:
        • Implement validation for task data (e.g., ensure the due date is in the future).
        • Provide error messages for invalid input.
6.	File Storage:
        • Add functionality to save tasks to a text file and load them when the application starts.
        • Use file I/O to achieve this.
7.	Task Sorting:
        • Allow users to sort tasks based on different criteria (e.g., by due date or status).
        • Implement sorting algorithms.
8.	Task Filtering:
        • Implement filtering options to display tasks based on their status (e.g., completed or pending).
9.	Persistence:
        • Improve task persistence by saving data to a database (e.g., SQLite or H2) instead of a text file.
10.	Command-Line Arguments:
        • Modify the application to accept command-line arguments to perform actions (e.g., adding a task from the command line).
11.	Data Validation:
        • Enhance data validation by validating user input and handling potential exceptions gracefully.
12.	Error Handling:
        • Implement error handling to provide informative error messages for different situations.
13.	Documentation:
        • Create JavaDoc comments for your classes and methods to generate documentation.
14.	Unit Testing:
        • Write unit tests for critical parts of your code using JUnit or TestNG.
15.	User Guide:
        • Create a user guide or help section in the application to guide users on how to use it effectively.
16.	UI Improvement (Optional):
        • Consider improving the user interface using a library like Curses or creating a simple graphical user interface with JavaFX or Swing.
17.	Deployment (Optional):
        • Package the application as a JAR file and create a deployment script or installer.

Project: Simple Task Manager
Project Description: Create a console-based task management application in Java. Users can add, view, edit, and delete tasks. Tasks can have a title, description, due date, and status.
Detailed Tasks:
1.	Project Setup:
        • Create a new Java project using your preferred IDE or build tool.
        • Set up a Git repository for version control.
2.	Task Class:
        • Create a Task class with attributes like title, description, dueDate, and status.
        • Implement getter and setter methods for each attribute.
3.	User Interface (UI):
        • Build a simple text-based UI for the application using the console.
        • Create a menu system with options for adding, viewing, editing, and deleting tasks.
        • Display a welcome message and the list of available actions.
4.	Add a Task:
        • Allow the user to add a new task.
        • Prompt the user to input the task's title, description, due date, and status (e.g., pending or completed).
        • Validate the due date to ensure it's in the future.
5.	View Tasks:
        • Implement a feature to view all existing tasks.
        • List tasks with their titles, due dates, and statuses.
6.	Edit a Task:
        • Enable users to edit an existing task.
        • Allow the user to select a task by its ID and update its attributes.
7.	Delete a Task:
        • Implement a feature to delete a task by its ID.
        • Ask for confirmation before deleting the task.
8.	File Storage:
        • Create a file (e.g., "tasks.txt") to store task data.
        • Implement methods to read tasks from the file at application startup and save tasks to the file when changes are made.
9.	Sorting Tasks:
        • Allow users to sort tasks based on different criteria (e.g., title, due date, or status).
        • Implement sorting algorithms for the task list.
10.	Filtering Tasks:
        • Enable users to filter tasks based on their status (e.g., view only completed or pending tasks).
11.	Command-Line Arguments:
        • Modify the application to accept command-line arguments to perform actions (e.g., adding a task, editing a task, etc.).
12.	Data Validation:
        • Enhance data validation by checking user input for potential errors.
        • Display informative error messages for invalid input.
13.	Error Handling:
        • Implement error handling for exceptional situations (e.g., file I/O errors or invalid data).
        • Provide clear error messages to users.
14.	Persistence with a Database (Optional):
        • Replace the file storage with a database (e.g., SQLite or H2).
        • Create tables to store task data and implement database access methods.
15.	Unit Testing:
        • Write unit tests using a testing framework like JUnit or TestNG.
        • Test critical methods, including those responsible for task sorting and filtering.
16.	User Guide:
        • Create a user guide or help section that explains how to use the application.
        • Include information on all available commands and features.
17.	JavaDoc Documentation:
        • Add JavaDoc comments to your classes and methods to generate documentation.
18.	UI Improvement (Optional):
